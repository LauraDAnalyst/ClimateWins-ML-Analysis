This speculative project analyzes the potential of three machine learning models: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

I applied these three models to data taken from the [European Climate Assessment and Data Set project](https://www.ecad.eu/). 
The goal was to identify the model with the highest potential for predicting effects of climate change based on current weather data.
